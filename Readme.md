This is where BinEnhance's code and data are stored<br>

[Eval]For now, considering the high coupling of the current code, only the code and data needed for the evaluation experiments and the code of the model in the paper have been released, and the complete code and data will be released gradually:<br>

1. Install the required environment, the python environment we use is python3.8<br>

```python
pip install -r Requirements.txt
```

2. Download the validation dataset from [OneDrive]([OneDrive (live.com)]([https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=!AEB85BVgg38gBkw&id=EA9FB056053D7CE5!106&cid=EA9FB056053D7CE5&parId=root&parQt=sharedby&o=OneUp](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuV8PQVWsJ_qgSwEwUZBNlVjlzUC?e=K3ryoH))) :<br>

   This validation dataset contains embeddings of all functions in the validation dataset generated by the five methods used in the paper (Gemini, Asm2vec, TREX, Asteria, jTrans), as well as all embeddings enhanced by BinEnhance. There are 13 folders after unpacking the validation dataset. `Asm2vec` and `Asm2vec+BinEnhance` are the embedding files generated by the original method and BinEnhance. The other models are similar. `Eval_datas` is the evaluation function pool of different models. `RTFs` is all functions' three robust text features. `save_models` is our trained model. <br>

3. Use the storage path of the validation dataset downloaded in step 2 to run Eval.py<br>

```python
python Eval.py --data-path="xxx/dataset1_Eval"
```
